# Day93-Dino-Game-Bot
This is a simple bot made for the dinosaur game provided by google crome.

This bot is made using python and pygui and currently only works in dark mode of the game. Since this is my first time working with pygui this might not be the best approach, this is just what came to my mind.

Another thing is this bot currently does not work properly as the code is not the issue but the speed/processing of pygui is.(could by device issue) This doesn't always jump even though it identifies obstacle and pushes the buttons.(I don't fully understand why this is happening)
